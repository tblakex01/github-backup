# AWS IaC CI/CD Project

This project was entirely developed using ChatGPT and the Noteable plugin. It demonstrates the implementation of:

- Generation of IaC for a CI/CD pipeline (CloudFormation, CodePipeline and CodeBuild)
- Deploying the IaC using the AWS Python SDK  (boto3)
- Deploying code to GitHub using the GitHub API.
- Creation of a GitHub documents i.e. README.md.
- Configuring AWS Security Services i.e. Macie, Security Hub, Config.
